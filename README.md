# PyBer Ride Share Data Analysis
Analyzing rider and driver data by type of cities. 

Overview:
This analysis examines PyBer's ride share data. Specfically we will compare how the data differs by city and make recommendations to address disparities among the city types. We received two sets of data; rider and driver and merged the data based on the name of the City. This allowed us to collect the City name, date of ride share, the fare amount, ride id, the driver and the type of city. 

Results:
Breaking the data down further we discovered the total rides per city type were:
Urban: 1,625
Suburban: 625
Rural: 125 

The total number of drivers for each city type were:
Urban: 2,405
Suburban: 490
Rural: 78

The total sum of fares for each city typer were: 
Urban: $39,854.38
Suburban: $19,356.33
Rural: $4,327.93

The average fare per ride for each city type were:
Urban: $24.53
Suburban: $30.97
Rural: $34.62

The average fare per driver for each city type were:
Urban: $16.57
Suburban: $39.50
Rural: $55.49

Summary:
The data conclusively shows the Urban cities have more rides, which is expected as there is a larger population. Additionally the Urban average fare is 70% of the Rural average fare ($24.53 and $34.62). At face value this may seem to be less profitable but with 13 times the amount of rides the Urban market is significantly more profitable. We suggest continuing to entice more people in Urban areas utilizing incentives for new driver sign-ups and first time rider discounts. While examining the data it seems there is room to grow in the Suburban markets, still a large enough population with a steady need for ride sharing. Larger compaigns to promote PyBer could go a long way in both driver sign-ups and new rider engagement. As for the Rural cities, they seem to have more frequent peaks, perhaps around holiday weekends or specific events. We suggest a deeper dive into three Rural cities and examining peak dates. From there PyBer will be able run a trial to time marketing efforts accordingly. Some suggestions would include driver bonus for New Year's Eve, or first time rider discount for town specific festival.
