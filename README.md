# PyBer Ride Share Data Analysis
Analyzing rider and driver data by type of cities. 

The purpose of this analysis is to examine the ride share data. We took two sets of data; rider and driver and merged the data based on the name of the City. This allowed us to collect the City name, date of ride share, the fare amount, ride id, the driver and the type of city. 

Breaking the data down further we discovered the total rides per city type were:
Urban: 1,625
Suburban: 625
Rural: 125 

The total number of drivers for each city type were:
Urban: 2,405
Suburban: 490
Rural: 78

The total sum of fares for each city typer were: 
Urban: $39,854.38
Suburban: $19,356.33
Rural: $4,327.93

The average fare per ride for each city type were:
Urban: $24.53
Suburban: $30.97
Rural: $34.62

The average fare per driver for each city type were:
Urban: $16.57
Suburban: $39.50
Rural: $55.49
